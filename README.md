For anyone that is interested in my vimrc, i will have a commit log below
documenting each one of my commits (easy to C-f the change you want to know
about though i would just suggest `git log -S`).

Added the Mofiqul/dracula.nvim theme and using lualine for the modeline.
Also now using indent-blankline for whitespace highlighting, useful in Python.
Using nerdcommenter for toggle commenting.
Using Navbuddy for navigating code quickly.
Using Merginal for git branching.
